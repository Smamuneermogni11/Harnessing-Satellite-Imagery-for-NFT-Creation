# NFT_Project
GeoVerde is a team of academics and students launching a series of NFT tokens of
environmentally endangered locations around the world.
Glaciers, barrier reefs, and forests around the world are going away, some perhaps
forever. We’d like to save them.
GeoVerde plans to help sustain and preserve these endangered locations using GIS
technology and high-resolution digital images that will be available for sale on NFT
platforms. We will help sustain the locations by geo-coding and archiving collections of
unique, data-rich, NFT-based digital twins of the locations. We will help preserve the
locations by giving 10% of all sales to NGOs and Non-Profits directly associated with
the locations.
GeoVerde is currently in the pilot launch phase. And we’re looking for talented, engaged
students to help launch the pilot. The goal of the pilot is to launch a small series of NFTs
to test market reaction and optimize the steps in our launch process. Follow-up
opportunities beyond the semester will also be available to interested students.
Additional details about GeoVerde and the pilot project for your GIS lab can be found

About Us:
As the world grapples with the devastating effects of climate change, there is a growing
sense of urgency to protect the planet's most vulnerable landscapes. In response to this
global crisis, we are proud to present a series of five unique and captivating NFT
artworks that showcase the beauty and fragility of landscapes most affected by climate
change.
Each artwork in this series is based on GIS (Geographic Information System) images of
varying landscapes, including icebergs, glaciers, and land masses most vulnerable to
climate devastation. Each digital artwork carries a call to action and responsibility to
protect the precious ecosystems they represent.
Once purchased, NFT holders become citizen scientists capable of monitoring and
tracking changes in the landmasses they have purchased images of. Detailed
instructions for joining, tracking, and monitoring will be dispersed upon purchasing the
NFTs and entry into a private network of climate activists, scholars, and citizens
dedicated to fighting climate change.
Additionally, we will give 10% of our proceeds to international and indigenous-led
organizations fighting for #landback efforts and climate justice.
By generating the NFTs, GeoVerde creates three types of value: (1) the planet has
thousands of beautiful landscapes, and the NFTs generated from them have aesthetic
value as digital art objects; (2) the NFTs are unique digital tokens, and each acts as a
store of economic value and a medium of exchange; (3) the project has a social
purpose, and the built-in smart contract creates social value by returning 10% to
organizations fighting climate change every time an NFT is exchanged.
Our Mission Statement:
GeoVerde combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and blockchain
technologies to propel pathways for environmental awareness and action amidst the
ongoing climate crisis.
GeoVerde is more than an NFT project; it is a movement driven by passion, creativity
and social responsibility that uses the transformative power of art and technology to
make lasting impacts on the fight against climate change.
Our Values:
1. Impactful Climate Advocacy: We utilize blockchain technology and NFTs as
impactful tools that highlight the effects of climate change and enable holders to
monitor and engage in advocacy;
2. Charitable Contribution: We understand the urgency of addressing climate
change and are committed to making a meaningful difference by ensuring 10% of
proceeds support international and indigenous-led environmental organizations
and causes related to climate change;
3. Data-Informed Innovation: The climate crisis is fluid and pressing which drives us
to ensure the data and tools we develop are easily accessible and empower
ordinary citizens to play a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable future;
4. Engaging Community Building: We understand the importance of community in
driving change. We seek to foster meaningful interactions, answer questions, and
provide insights into our project while cultivating a supportive community of
individuals who share our values and mission;
5. Uniqueness and Collectibility: Collectors gain ownership of exclusive features
and designs, fostering pride in their contribution to our mission. Our multi-NFT
rewards further cement the bond between our brand and supporters.
Descriptions of Our Planned NFTs:
The first artwork in the series, "Melting Miniverse," is a breathtaking depiction of an
iceberg floating in a sea of turquoise water. The intricate details of the iceberg are
captured in stunning high resolution, with each crevice and facet of the ice perfectly
illuminated. The colors and textures in this piece are mesmerizing, evoking a sense of
awe and wonder at the fluid ephemerality of our world. As we look closer, we can see
the signs of climate change, with the ice slowly melting and breaking apart. This piece
serves as a powerful reminder of the urgent need to address the climate crisis and
protect our planet's most vulnerable landscapes.
The second artwork, "Fractal Fragility," takes us to a remote corner of the world, where
a fragile ecosystem is struggling to survive. The image is a GIS rendering of a section of
the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation and climate change are threatening the
delicate balance of this incredible ecosystem. In this piece, we see the lush greenery of
the forest canopy juxtaposed with the barren, brown earth below. The intricate details of
the leaves and trees are brought to life in vivid detail, reminding us of the immense
biodiversity that exists in this ecosystem. However, the stark contrast between the
vibrant canopy and the barren ground below highlights the urgent need to address the
threat.
The third artwork in the series, "Casual Catastrophe," is a stunning digital
representation of a glacier slowly melting away. The intricate details of the ice and snow
are captured in exquisite detail, with shades of blue and white blending seamlessly
together to create a mesmerizing visual experience. However, as we look closer, we can
see the signs of climate change in the form of the melting ice and the pools of fresh
water forming around the glacier. This piece serves as a poignant reminder of the
urgent need to reduce global temperatures and preserve the Earth's glaciers which act
as natural resevoirs and sources of fresh water for communities around the world.
The fourth artwork in the series, "Rising Sea Levels," takes us to the coastlines of the
world, where rising sea levels are threatening communities and ecosystems. The image
is a GIS rendering of a coastline, where the blue of the sea meets the brown of the land.
In this piece, we see the intricate details of the coastline, with each wave and ripple of
the water perfectly captured in digital form. However, as we look closer, we can see the
water levels threaten to inundate communities and destroy vital ecosystems. This piece
serves as a call to action to address the threat of rising sea levels and protect our
planet's coastlines.
The final artwork in the series, "Endangered Species," is a moving tribute to the many
species that are at risk of extinction due to climate change. The image is a GIS
rendering of a section of the Great Barrier Reef, where rising sea temperatures and
ocean acidification are causing irreparable damage.
Another idea we plan to explore is an NFT based on a GIS image of bauxite mines in
Jamaica. The image could capture the stark contrast between the rugged, rocky terrain
of the mines and the lush greenery that surrounds them as well as the threat to
indigenous sovereignty the mines pose to traditional Maroon settlements protected
under the UN Declaration of Indigenous rights."
